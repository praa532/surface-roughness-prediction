# Surface Roughness Prediction
# ntroduction
This Markdown file documents the M.Tech thesis project on surface roughness prediction using machine learning. The objective of the project was to predict surface roughness using four supervised algorithms: Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), and Random Forest (RF).

# Dataset
The first step in the project was to gather and preprocess the dataset for training and testing the machine learning models. The dataset consisted of various features related to the manufacturing process and the corresponding surface roughness measurements.

# Algorithms Used
The following supervised algorithms were implemented and evaluated for the surface roughness prediction task:

Decision Tree Regressor (DTR): A non-parametric regression algorithm that creates a tree-like model to make predictions.

XGBoost: An optimized gradient boosting library known for its high performance and efficiency in machine learning competitions.

Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR): Another gradient boosting algorithm that builds an ensemble of weak learners to make accurate predictions.

Random Forest (RF): A popular ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

# Experimental Setup
The dataset was divided into training and testing sets, ensuring the models were evaluated on unseen data. Each algorithm was trained using the training data, and hyperparameters were tuned to optimize their performance.

To assess the models, several evaluation metrics were employed, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) score.

# Results
The performance of each algorithm was compared based on the evaluation metrics. The results indicated the algorithm that provided the most accurate and reliable surface roughness predictions.

# Conclusion
The M.Tech thesis project successfully explored and implemented four supervised machine learning algorithms for surface roughness prediction. The obtained results shed light on which algorithm performed best for this specific task, providing valuable insights for future manufacturing process improvements.
